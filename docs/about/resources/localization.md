# Providing localized text content

The table below contains all the strings that may be localized or changed for the SDK:

- :material-check: __default__ value is included in the SDK but may be changed or localized
    
- :material-close: __sample__ value that needs to be provided explicitly

!!! tip 
    You can select the table content **excluding the header**, copy and paste it into Google Sheets for translation purposes.
