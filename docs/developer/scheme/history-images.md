# History Images

The History Images represent a user's interaction history in the Aiuta SDK, including boths user-uploaded and Aiuta-provided images.

## Input Image

```typescript
InputImage {
    id: string,// (1)!
    url: string,// (2)!
    owner: OwnerType,// (3)!
}
```

1.  A unique string identifier assigned to the image by the Aiuta API, ensuring each image can be distinctly recognized and referenced within the system.
2.  The URL pointing to the location of the image resource, which can be accessed and retrieved by the SDK to present in the UI.
3.  The type of the image [owner :octicons-arrow-down-24:](#owner-type).

Input images used in the Aiuta SDK for try-on sessions can either be uploaded by users, such as photos taken with their camera or selected from their gallery, or they can be predefined model images provided by Aiuta.

## Generated Image

```typescript
GenegaredImage {
    id: string,// (1)!
    url: string,// (2)!
    owner: OwnerType,// (3)!
    productIds: List<string>,// (4)!
}
```

1.  A unique string identifier assigned to the image by the Aiuta API, ensuring each image can be distinctly recognized and referenced within the system.
2.  The URL pointing to the location of the image resource, which can be accessed and retrieved by the SDK to present in the UI.
3.  The type of the image [owner :octicons-arrow-down-24:](#owner-type).
4.  A list of product identifiers that were utilized during the image generation process. Each identifier corresponds to a specific product involved in the try-on session, allowing for precise tracking and reference within the system.

Generated images represent the results of try-on sessions. These images are generated based on either a photo uploaded by the user or a predefined model image provided by Aiuta.

## Owner Type

```typescript
enum OwnerType {
    user,// (1)!
    aiuta,// (2)!
}
```

1.  Image uploaded or generated by the user (using a camera or from a gallery).
    
    !!! note ""
        This image belongs to the user. When the user removes the image from the history, it __may be deleted__ from the storage as well.

2.  Image of the model provided or generated by the Aiuta. 

    !!! note ""
        This image could be linked to the user history, but it is not owned by the user, and __can not be deleted__ from the storage, only unlinked from the user's history in case of removing.


Owner type primarily determines the source of origin of the image â€” whether it was generated by the user as a result of any chain of operations from upload to generation, possibly including re-generation. Alternatively, the image is not associated with the user's personal data and does not belong to them. This allows different approaches to be taken when deleting images from the history.

!!! warning "Do not delete `aiuta` owned image files"
    Well, you can make a request to delete such an image, nothing terrible will happen, but be prepared that Aiuta API will return an error when you try.

    But ideally, you should only link/unlink those images in the user's history.
