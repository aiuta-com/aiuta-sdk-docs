# History Images

The History Images represent a user's interaction history in the Aiuta SDK, including boths user-uploaded and Aiuta-provided images.

## Input Image

Input images used in the Aiuta SDK for try-on sessions can either be uploaded by users, such as photos taken with their camera or selected from their gallery, or they can be predefined model images provided by Aiuta.

```typescript
InputImage {
    id: string, // (1)!
    url: string, // (2)!
    type: InputImageType // (3)!
}

enum InputImageType {
    uploaded, // (4)!
    inputModel, // (5)!
}
```


1.  A unique string identifier assigned to the image by the Aiuta API, ensuring each image can be distinctly recognized and referenced within the system.
2.  The URL pointing to the location of the image resource, which can be accessed and retrieved by the SDK to present in the UI.
3.  The type of the image origin.
4.  Image uploaded by the user (taken from the camera or gallery). 
    
    !!! note ""
        This image belongs to the user. When the user removes the image from the history, it may be deleted from the storage as well.

5.  Image of the model provided by the Aiuta. 

    !!! note ""
        This image could be linked to the user history, but it is not owned by the user, and __can not be deleted__, only unlinked from the user's history in case of removing.

## Generated Image

Generated images represent the results of try-on sessions. These images are generated based on either a photo uploaded by the user or a predefined model image provided by Aiuta.


```typescript
GenegaredImage {
    id: string, // (1)!
    url: string, // (2)!
    type: GenegaredImageType // (3)!
    productIds: List<string> // (4)!
}

enum GenegaredImageType {
    generated, // (5)!
    outputModel, // (6)!
}
```

1.  A unique string identifier assigned to the image by the Aiuta API, ensuring each image can be distinctly recognized and referenced within the system.
2.  The URL pointing to the location of the image resource, which can be accessed and retrieved by the SDK to present in the UI.
3.  The type of the image origin.
4.  A list of product identifiers that were utilized during the image generation process. Each identifier corresponds to a specific product involved in the try-on session, allowing for precise tracking and reference within the system.
5.  Image generated by the Aiuta API. This image belongs to the user as well. 

    !!! note ""
        When the user removes the image from the history, it may be deleted from the storage as well.

6.  Generated image of the model provided by the Aiuta. 

    !!! note ""
        This image could be linked to the user history, but it is not owned by the user, and __can not be deleted__, only unlinked from the user's history in case of removing.
